# Drop Schema Objetcs

## Oracle PL/SQL solution to drop objects within the current schema


The **DROP_SCHEMA_OBJETCS.sql** script is removing the objects in the current schema until every object has drop, or can not remove more.
The remaining Objects (if there is still any) must drop by manually after reason of problem has eliminated.
